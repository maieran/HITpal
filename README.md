Mike Mentzer's High-Intensity Training (HIT) Principles
Overview:

Mike Mentzer revolutionized bodybuilding with his High-Intensity Training (HIT) philosophy, which emphasizes maximum effort and intensity over volume. The primary focus is on performing each exercise with perfect form and reaching muscular failure within a minimal number of sets. This approach minimizes workout frequency while maximizing results, allowing for full recovery and growth.

Key Principles of HIT:

Intensity: Each exercise should be performed with maximum effort, reaching muscle failure within 1-2 sets.
Volume: Low volume; typically 1-2 sets per exercise.
Frequency: Infrequent workouts (3 days per week) to allow for full recovery.
Form and Tempo: Slow, controlled movements with a focus on form to maximize muscle tension and reduce the risk of injury.
Training Structure:

The program is divided into three training days: Push, Pull, and Legs. Each day focuses on different muscle groups with a combination of compound and isolation exercises to ensure balanced development.
